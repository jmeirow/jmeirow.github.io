I started programming in 1983 at the Marine Corps Computer Sciences Center in Quantico, VA.  What I can I say? It beat the hell out of being a grunt.

Writing code makes the time go by faster than just about any kind of activity I can think of. These days I am most interested in schools of thought such as Domain Driven Design, Command Query Responsibility Segregation and Event Sourcing.
