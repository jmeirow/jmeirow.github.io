### Introducing NoSQLServer

This is the first in a series of blog posts in which I'll discuss the rationale for building applications using a NoSQL philosophy 
utilizing a primarily "NoSQL" phiosophy, but implemented SQL Server.

My tentative approach to covering this topic unfolds something like this:

* NoSQL Philosophy
* Why NoSQL on SQL Server? (or any RDBMS?)
* Approach
* Trade-offs
* Advantages
* Feature list
* Code - AggregateType
* Code - AggregateBase
* Code - RepositoryBase
* Code - DBWriter
* Code - Cascading Update
* Code - An implementation
* Code - Another impelentation
* Code - NoSQLServer Client
* Summary
