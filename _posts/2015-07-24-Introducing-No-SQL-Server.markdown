### Introducing NoSQLServer

This is the first in a series of blog posts in which I'll discuss the rationale for building applications using a NoSQL philosophy 
but implemented on SQL Server.  

I've named this little project "NoSQLServer". 
I like the [inconspicuously ambiguous](http://users.ohiohills.com/gordon/liar.html) name because it will appeal to larger audience than
if I were to add a space here, or a hyphen there. (NoSQL-Server or No SQLServer?)

My tentative approach to covering this series unfolds something like this:

* NoSQL Philosophy
* Why NoSQL on SQL Server? (or any RDBMS?)
* Approach
* Trade-offs
* Advantages
* Feature list
* Code - AggregateType
* Code - AggregateBase
* Code - RepositoryBase
* Code - DBWriter
* Code - Cascading Update
* Code - An implementation
* Code - Another implementation
* Code - NoSQLServer Client
* Summary
